Part 3 assignment - Obtain the activities of daily life dataset from the UC Irvine machine learning
website (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dataset+for+ADL+Recognition+with+Wrist-worn+Accelerometer
data provided by Barbara Bruno, Fulvio Mastrogiovanni and Antonio Sgorbissa).
(a) Build a classifier that classifies sequences into one of the 14 activities provided.
To make features, you should vector quantize, then use a histogram
of cluster centers (as described in the subsection; this gives a pretty explicit
set of steps to follow). You will find it helpful to use hierarchical
k-means to vector quantize. You may use whatever multi-class classifier
you wish, though I’d start with R’s decision forest, because it’s easy to
use and effective. You should report (a) the total error rate and (b) the
class confusion matrix of your classifier.
(b) Now see if you can improve your classifier by (a) modifying the number
of cluster centers in your hierarchical k-means and (b) modifying the size
of the fixed length samples that you use.
